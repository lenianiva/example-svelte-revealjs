## Markdown test

This is a page from markdown!

```lean
{ x := 5, y := 6 }
```
The code escapes itself!

## More markdown

Math works here too, and you don't need to write HTML escape codes.

`\[\begin{aligned} \dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\ \dot{y} & = \rho x - y -
  xz \\ \dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy \end{aligned} \]`
